The author interacts with the iffinity engine via the `ifc` (iffinity compiler) command line tool:

```
$ ifc -h
~~~ The iffinity engine compiler ~~~

Running ifc with no command is equivalent to running ifc compile.

For help and options of a specific command, run:
ifc <command> --help/-h (e.g. ifc show --help)

Usage: ifc [command] [commandOptions]

Commands:
  ifc compile [options]  Compile the project in the given directory to a single
                         HTML file                                     [default]
  ifc init               Create a new iffinity project in the current directory
  ifc edit [options]     Edit the configuration file of the project
  ifc show [options]     Show several project details

Options:
  -p, --projectRoot  The root directory of the project (if not specified, the
                     current directory is used)                         [string]
  -c, --config       Specify a configuration file for your project (default:
                     <projectRoot>/iff-config.json)                     [string]
  -o, --outputFile   The output HTML file path                          [string]
  -t, --testFrom     Test the story from a different snippet than the start
                     snippet                                            [string]
  -v, --version      Show iffinity engine version number               [boolean]
  -h, --help         Show help                                         [boolean]
```

## The `init` command

As explained in the previous page, the `init` command aims to help the author create a stub for their iffinity project. It covers the required fields of the [configuration file](/config/) (as well as a bit more), and optionally creates an example game as a template. It is heavily inspired by the behavior of `npm init`. Note that it is preferable to run `ifc init` in a newly created, empty directory.

## The `compile` command

```
$ ifc compile -h
ifc compile [options]

Compile the project in the given directory to a single HTML file

Options:
  -p, --projectRoot  The root directory of the project (if not specified, the
                     current directory is used)                         [string]
  -c, --config       Specify a configuration file for your project (default:
                     <projectRoot>/iff-config.json)                     [string]
  -o, --outputFile   The output HTML file path                          [string]
  -t, --testFrom     Test the story from a different snippet than the start
                     snippet                                            [string]
  -v, --version      Show iffinity engine version number               [boolean]
  -h, --help         Show help                                         [boolean]
```

The default command (i.e. `ifc compile` is the same as `ifc`). It expects to find an iffinity configuration file with the name `iff-config.json` in the current directory (if the `-c` flag is not specified) and attempts to compile the project into a single output HTML. The command's options are pretty self-explanatory from the help message above. An example of running `ifc` on the template project that `ifc init` creates:

```
$ ifc
Config checks
  Story title: test
  Story author name: sotiris
  Story version: 1.0.0
Basic sanity checks
  Found 2 snippet(s) across 1 file(s).
  Found 1 starting snippet(s).
So far so good. Compiling...
Rendered game saved to test.html. Enjoy!
```

### Testing from a different snippet

By using the `--testFrom/-t` option, you can instruct `iffinity` to compile your story to an HTML named (by default) `<story name>_from_<testing snippet>.html` where the snippet provided will be the starting snippet instead of the one with the `start` attribute. This facilitates rapid testing of specific snippets without having to change the `start` attribute in your source code every time.

## The `edit` command

```
$ ifc edit [options]

Edit the configuration file of the project

Options:
  -c, --config                  Specify a configuration file for your project

```

A utility command to help the author edit the configuration file in an automatic, non-manual way. The help message as well as the examples above are pretty self-explanatory. Note that it is totally OK to edit the configuration file manually.

## The `show` command

```
ifc show -h
ifc show [options]

Show several project details

Options:
  -p, --projectRoot  The root directory of the project                  [string]
  -c, --config       Specify a configuration file for your project (default:
                     <projectRoot>/iff-config.json)                     [string]
  -s, --snippets     Show all snippets in the project                  [boolean]

```

The `show` commands aims to help the user gain insight on their project, especially as it grows larger and larger. It's 3 main options as of v0.2.0 are the following:

### `ifc show --snippets`

The `--snippets/-s` option shows a tree of each file in the project that contains at least one snippet, accompanied by the details of each snippet (name, tags, scripts, styles, whether it is the starting snippet).

Running it on the [convoluted example](https://github.com/zehanort/iffinity/tree/main/examples/convoluted):

```
$ ifc show --snippets
Snippets in project Three Snippets
(files relative to project root: <path>/iffinity/examples/convoluted)
|
├── some-snippets.ejs
│   ├── Magic Place
│   │   ├── tags: THE_WILD
│   │   ├── scripts: scripts/mp1.js, scripts/mp2.js
│   │   └── styles: styles/mp.css
│   ├── Intro [START]
│   └── Square
└── the-castle/the-castle.ejs
    └── Castle
        └── tags: THE_WILD, CASTLE
```

### `ifc show --tags`

The `--tags/-t` option shows a list of all the tags in the project, accompanied by the list of all the snippets that contain them.

Running it on the [convoluted example](https://github.com/zehanort/iffinity/tree/main/examples/convoluted):

```
$ ifc show --tags
Tags in project Three Snippets
(files relative to project root: /home/sotiris/projects/intfiction/iffinity/examples/convoluted)
|
├── THE_WILD
│   ├── Magic Place (some-snippets.ejs)
│   └── Castle (the-castle/the-castle.ejs)
└── CASTLE
    └── Castle (the-castle/the-castle.ejs)
```

### `ifc show --graph`

This is an **EXPERIMENTAL** option. Running it will open a browser window with an interactive graph of the story snippets and their links. The starting snippet is drawn in blue, while all others in green. Interactive *doesn't* mean editable; there is no way to affect the project via the graph. In other words, it is a read-only view of the project.
